UTIA, Underprivileged the information app
Our topic for this project was on Poverty and Inequality. The research question was: 
How has COVID-19 affected poverty in different countries?
The reason we chose this topic was to make it known of the increasing poverty rate caused by the ongoing pandemic which has plagued many inhabitants and 
had a worse effect on people who lost their jobs or businesses.
We have made an app called Underprivileged, The Information App, or U.T.I.A. for short. The app provides information on the poverty cases in the seven continents 
of the world like South America, North America, Europe, Africa and Asia,  each of which gives information on 5 countries in it. 
The appâ€™s main purpose is to inform people about poverty. This can help raise awareness in people so that they can know what is happening around them. 
The app also shows the percentage of poverty in the area so that people can help reduce it after knowing the information. 
This app was mainly made to raise awareness to people of different countries on the poverty of other countries or their own, 
which could help in decreasing poverty so that there may be no more poverty in the world which could help build the economy
The economy will one day rise due to the depletion of poverty because of this informative app

The UTIA App has been developed using Apple's new UI framework SwiftUI and programming language Swift.
